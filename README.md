# DatPart
Proof of concept Dat site viewer for Chrome.

Sites can be loaded via the .dat_site. top-level domain.

For example you can load the Acrylic Style Dat site at http://1c7639eedaf8f7533f92e7c34f5a6d2b43645347836ab5e9f2489e89d3b08306.dat_site/

Oh also, Chrome's Omnibar treats all non-standard TLDs as searches, so you'll have to type the inital HTTP:// or put a slash at the end of the URL for it to load the site.

(BitTorrent/WebTorrent support coming soon, it's already coded into the extension)
